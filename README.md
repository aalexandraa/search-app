# search-app

Find the best possible train journey within a given time frame for the best price. Frontend for trvlr.

[Try it here](https://trvlr-search-app.herokuapp.com)

## Install & get started

``` sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Opens https://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Ideas

- parameters like class, BahnCard, preferred times in a saved profile
- input should be plaintext or markdown, something humanly editable, maybe some smart code embedded into plaintext
- the input should live in dropbox, icloud or somethign that can be shared and edited easily
- there should be a text message notification if a certain condition is met (price < 50 for hamburg weekend within next 30 days)
- add memoization
- add limited concurrency
- search for both first and second class trains, show best trip per class
